            Note that in this talk I mistakenly state that the dual rotating retarder mueller polarimeter has not been introduced to astronomy. This is (likely) incorrect. What I had meant to say was that it had not been introduced to my collaborators within astronomy, who tend to measure purely linear polarization in their work.
